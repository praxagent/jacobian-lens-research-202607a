# Results — fitting our own lenses

_Only executed runs. RunPod A6000, jlens.fit, wikitext-103 corpus._

## 1. Validation gate — gpt2 (PASSED, 2026-07-08)

Fit our own gpt2 lens (100 wikitext prompts, seed 0, dim_batch 8) and CKA-compared its
J-lens token geometry to **Neuronpedia's** pre-fitted gpt2 lens, per layer:

```
shared layers: 11 | mean CKA(ours, neuronpedia) = 0.9992 (min 0.999, max 1.000)
per-layer: 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00
```

**Our fitter reproduces Anthropic/Neuronpedia's lens essentially perfectly.** This
validates the whole pipeline end-to-end (fit_lens.py, our jlens usage, and the CKA
methodology the emergence sweep rests on), so bigger fits are trustworthy. It also means
the emergence-sweep numbers — which use these lenses — sit on a faithful foundation.

## 2. Seed/corpus stability — qwen3-4b (in progress)

Fitting Qwen3-4B on 3 different corpus subsets (seeds 0/1/2, 100 prompts, dim_batch 16),
then pairwise CKA. **Question:** is J-space a stable property of the model, or dependent
on the fitting seed/corpus? High cross-seed CKA → stable/real (strengthens every emergence
claim and closes the "one lens per model" limitation). Low → fitting-dependent (a real,
honest limitation to report). [Numbers on completion.]
